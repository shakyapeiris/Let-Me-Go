Let Me Go is a mobile application which was build in order to notify vehicle drivers when an ambulance is near to them within a specific distance during traffics. I built this application as my project for **Hackeram** which is an online student run hackathon.

## What is the challenge?

According to my experience I have seen lots of incidents where Ambulance drivers had to face huge difficulies during traffic time. Even, this may cause death to the patients due to delay in treatments.

## Future plans

- [ ] Intergrate with Call The Doctor
- [ ] Add more functionalities like listing out the patient details and past missions, etc..
- [ ] Improve the UI
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Add a CI pipeline for the front end

## How to contribute

- For the repository
- Clone the repo by running `git clone <url>`
- Make changes and commit them with `git add <filename/path>` and `git commit -m <message>`
- Push changes to forked repo with `git push origin main`
- And send a pull request to main repo
